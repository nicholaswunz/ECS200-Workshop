Understanding the right measures of central tendency and spread is critical before conducting any formal hypothesis testing.\n\n\n![](images/base_visual.png)\n\n## Background reading {.unnumbered}\n\n\nBefore we can decide on the appropriate descriptive stats it helps to understand the **scale** of your variable.\nThe table below outlines appropriate measures for both qualitative and quantitative variables:\n\n| Data Scale | Type         | Definition                                      | Examples                          | Central Tendency | Spread/Variation              |\n|:----------:|:------------:|:-----------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------:|:----------------:|:-----------------------------:|\n| Nominal    | Qualitative  | Named categories with no intrinsic order        | sex (male/female), species name   | Mode             | Count, Proportion             |\n| Ordinal    | Qualitative  | Named categories data with a natural order      | life stage (egg, juvenile, adult) | Median, Mode     | Range, IQR                    |\n| Interval   | Quantitative | Equal intervals between values but no true zero | temperature, pH, dates            | Mean, Median     | SD, SE, CI                    |\n| Ratio      | Quantitative | Equal intervals and a true zero                 | length, age, body mass            | Mean, Median     | SD, SE, CV, IQR, CI, variance | \n\n\nWhen laying out your datasheet for your study, it is important to know what data types each column will be when imported into R. Here is an example data sheet that is color-coded according to the type of variable: [nominal]{style=\"background-color: #fadbfa;\"}, [continuous]{style=\"background-color: #cce8ff;\"}, [ordinal]{style=\"background-color: #fff2c0;\"}, and [binary]{style=\"background-color: #c6fbf5;\"}.\n\n![](images/types-of-variables.png)\n\nKey Terms used in this workshop:\n\n- **Mean**: Average value. Use with symmetric, normally distributed data.\n- **Median**: Middle value. More robust to outliers and skewed data.\n- **Mode**: Most frequent value (useful for categories).\n- **Standard Deviation (SD)**: How spread out the data is.\n- **Standard Error (SE)**: SD divided by the square root of n (how precise the mean is).\n- **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**: SD / Mean. Compares spread across variables.\n- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Range between 25th and 75th percentiles.\n- **Confidence Interval (CI)**: A range that likely contains the true mean.\n- **Variance**: How much values differ from the average value.\n\n\nIf you are still confused by the terminologies, the CrashCourse Statistics videos on the [Mean, Median, and Mode: Measures of Central Tendency](https://youtu.be/kn83BA7cRNM?si=qzoPZk44hZRlzo9P) (11:22 min long), and the [Measures of Spread](https://youtu.be/R4yfNi_8Kqw?si=9QO_QzRmLG5oyQjH) (11:46 min long) better explains the terms visually.\n\n# Descriptive Statistics {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills}\n\n## Central tendancy {.unnumbered}\n\nDeciding on whether to use mean, median, or mode will depend on how your data is distributed. \nA skewed distribution can result in different outcomes of central tendancy if you are calculating using the mean, median, and mode. \n\n![](images/mean_mod_median.png)\n\nHere is a CrashCourse Statistics video on [The Shape of Data: Distributions](https://youtu.be/bPFNxD3Yg6U?si=MSoRYOukKdRFjGem) on other types of distributions encountered (11:22 min long).\nIn practice, mode is rarely used, but is often included in a discussion of mean and medians.\nFrom here, we will focus on mean and median, which can be calculated using the `mean()` and `median()` function, respectively. \n\n```{r fake, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\n#install.packages(\"cowplot\")\n\n# Load library\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\n# Create fake data distribution\nset.seed(1)\ndist_data <- data.frame(normal = rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 2),\n                        skewed = rexp(100, rate = 0.2))\n\ndist_data %>%\n  dplyr::summarise(normal_mean = mean(normal),\n                   normal_median = median(normal),\n                   skewed_mean = mean(skewed),\n                   skewed_median = median(skewed))\n\n```\n\nIf the data is normally distributed, the mean and median will be similar (e.g. normal = 10), but if the data is skewed, the mean and median will show different central tenancies (e.g. mean = 4.7, median = 3).\n\n## Spread {.unnumbered}\n\n\nWe can calculate the standard deviation, standard error, confidence interval, coefficient of variation, and variance with the following code\ncan be calculated using the `mean()` and `median()` function, respectively. \n\n```{r spread, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\n\ndist_data %>%\n  dplyr::summarise(\n    n = length(skewed),\n    mean = mean(skewed), # required for calculation of CI\n    variance = var(skewed),\n    sd = sd(skewed), # standard deviation\n    se = sd(skewed) / sqrt(n), # standard error\n    ci_lower = mean(skewed) - qt(0.975, df = n - 1) * se, # lower 5%\n    ci_upper = mean(skewed) + qt(0.975, df = n - 1) * se, # lower 95%\n    cv = sd(skewed) / mean(skewed) # coefficient of variation\n  )\n\n```\n\nRemember that the skewed data is strongly right-skewed so SD and CI must be interpreted carefully.\n\n- SD measures spread *around the mean* assuming deviations are roughly symmetric.\n- 95% CI assumes the *sampling distribution of the mean* is approximately normal.\n\nSkewed data violate this assumption.\nSE & CI describe uncertainty in the mean, not **variability** of the data.\n\nFor data measured at an [ordinal]{style=\"background-color: #fff2c0;\"} level, the range and interquartile range are the only appropriate measures of variability.\n\nFor more [continuous]{style=\"background-color: #cce8ff;\"} level data like interval and ratio levels, the SD and variance are also applicable.\n\nHere is a visualisation on SD (top) and 95% CI (bottom) for normal skewed data.\n\n```{r spread vis, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\n\ndist_dat_long <- dist_data %>%\n  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = \"data_type\", values_to = \"value\")\n\ndist_dat_stats <- dist_dat_long %>%\n  group_by(data_type) %>%\n  summarise(mean = mean(value),\n            sd = sd(value),\n            n = length(value),\n            se = sd(value) / sqrt(n),\n            ci_lower = mean(value) -

normal_min)\n\n# Option 1\nquantile(dist_data$normal)\n\n\n# Option 2 with dplyr (and it's possible to calculate by grouping)\ndist_data %>%\n  #dplyr::group_by(column_1, column_2) %>%\n  dplyr::summarise(min    = quantile(normal, probs = 0, na.rm = TRUE), \n                   Q1     = quantile(normal, probs = 0.25, na.rm = TRUE),\n                   median = quantile(normal, probs = 0.5, na.rm = TRUE),\n                   Q3     = quantile(normal, probs = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE),\n                   max    = quantile(normal, probs = 1, na.rm = TRUE),\n                   n      = n())\n\n```\n\nVisually for normal and skewed distributions, the quantiles would look like this.\nWe will need to convert the wide format of `dist_data` to long format.\n\n```{r quantile, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\n\ndist_data %>%\n    tidyr::pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = \"data_type\", values_to = \"value\") %>% # convert wide format to long format\nggplot(aes(x = data_type, y = value)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_classic()\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n### Exercise 1 (5 min) {.unnumbered}\n\n🧪 **Complete the following task for the `excerise_survey_data` below**\n\n\n```{r ex 1}\n\nexcerise_survey_data <- data.frame(\n  site = c(\"A\",\"A\",\"A\",\"B\",\"B\",\"B\",\"C\",\"C\",\"C\"),\n  plot = c(1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3),\n  species_1 = c(12, 7, 15, 4, 9, 6, 20, 18, 25),\n  species_2 = c(5, 2, 1, 10, 7, 4, 3, 1, 0),\n  species_3 = c(0, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 0, 1, 2),\n  species_4 = c(8, 6, 3, 1, 4, 2, 10, 7, 5)\n)\n\n```\n\n- Calculate mean, standard deviation, and sample size of species 3.\nYou can calculate sample size with `length()` function.\n- What is the mean number of species 3?

The `ggplot2` package, part of the tidyverse collection of packages, as well as its many extension packages are a great tool for data visualisation.\n\nThe gg in ggplot2 stands for grammar of graphics. Writing the code for your graph is like constructing a sentence made up of different parts that logically follow from one another. In a more visual way, it means adding layers that take care of different elements of the plot. Your plotting workflow will therefore be something like creating an empty plot, adding a layer with your data points, then your measure of uncertainty, the axis labels, and so on.\n\n![](images/ggplot_layout.png)\n\n\n\n### Independent vs dependent variables {.unnumbered}\n\nIn this example experiment data sheet, we have one [independent]{style=\"background-color: #bdfff8;\"} and three [dependent]{style=\"background-color: #d9daf8;\"} variables.\n\nThe other variables in the sheet can’t be classified as independent or dependent, but they do contain data that you will need in order to interpret your independent and dependent variables.\n\n![](images/independent-vs-dependent-variables.png)\n\n## Plot Types {.unnumbered}\n\nThere are so many ways to visualise your data beyond this workshop, so we will only focus a few common ones you will likely use in your report.\n\n![](images/DL_datavis1_which_plot.png)\n\nLet's say we are interested in visualising at differences in stem length in calcium-treated (**W1**) versus untreated (**Reference**) watersheds, there are a couple of ways we can visualise this.\n\n```{r load data, message=FALSE}\n\n# Load a CSV file\nplant_task_clean_data <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicholaswunz/ECS200-Workshop/refs/heads/main/data/plant_calcium_task.csv\") %>%\n  dplyr::mutate(watershed = recode(watershed, \"W2\" = \"W1\"),\n                watershed = as.factor(watershed),\n                transect  = as.factor(transect)) %>%\n  dplyr::filter(stem_dry_mass < 1)\n\n```\n\n::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills}\n\n\n## Histogram or density {.unnumbered}\n\nA [histogram](https://r-graph-gallery.com/histogram) and [density plot](https://r-graph-gallery.com/density-plot) takes as input a numeric variable only. The variable is cut into several bins, and the number of observation per bin is represented by the height of the bar. It is possible to represent the distribution of several variable on the same axis using this technique.\n\nTo create a histogram by group, use the `geom_histogram()` function within ggplot.\n\n```{r hist}\n\nplant_task_clean_data %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = stem_length, fill = watershed)) +\n  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.4, position = \"identity\") # changed transparency due to overlap in watershed groups\n\n```\n\nTo create a density plot by group, use the `geom_density()` function within ggplot.\n\n```{r density}\n\nplant_task_clean_data %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = stem_length, fill = watershed)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.4, position = \"identity\") # changed transparency due to overlap in watershed groups\n\n```\n\n## Boxplot {.unnumbered}\n\nA [boxplot](https://r-graph-gallery.com/89-box-and-scatter-plot-with-ggplot2.html) provides an effective summary of one or more numeric variables, showcasing key statistical features through its distinct elements:\n\n- **Median** Line: The line that divides the box represents the median of the data. For example, if the median is 10, this indicates that half of the data points lie below 10 and half above.\n- **Quartiles**: The ends of the box indicate the upper (Q3) and lower (Q1) quartiles. If Q3 is 15, this means that 75% of the observations fall below this value.\n- **Interquartile Range** (IQR): The difference between Quartiles 1 and 3 is known as the interquartile range (IQR), which measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data.\n- **Whiskers**: The lines extending from the box show the range of values within Q3 + 1.5 × IQR to Q1 - 1.5 × IQR, representing the highest and lowest values, excluding outliers.\n- **Outliers**: Dots (or other markers) beyond the whiskers indicate potential outliers in the dataset.\n\n![](images/boxplot.png)\n\nTo create a boxplot by group, use the `geom_boxplot()` function within ggplot.\n\n```{r boxplot}\n\nplant_task_clean_data %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = watershed, y = stem_length)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n```\n\n## Bar plot or dot plot {.unnumbered}\n\n\nTo plot the mean and standard deviation as a bar plot, use the `geom_bar()` function with `geom_errorbar()`.\n\n```{r bar}\n\nplant_sum <- plant_task_clean_data %>%\n  group_by(watershed) %>%\n  summarise(mean = mean(stem_length),\n            sd = sd(stem_length))\n\n\nplant_sum %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = watershed)) +\n  geom_bar(aes(y = mean), stat = \"identity\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean-sd, ymax = mean+sd), width = .02)\n\n```\n\nTo plot the mean and standard deviation as a dot plot, use the `geom_pointrange()`. It is also useful to include the raw data in this case, which you will need to call in the `plant_task_clean_data` and `plant_sum` separately and plot the raw data with the `geom_jitter()` function.\n\n```{r dot}\n\n# mean +/- sd only.\nmean_plot <- plant_sum %>%\n  ggplot() + \n  geom_pointrange(aes(x = watershed, y = mean, ymin = mean-sd, ymax = mean+sd))\n\n# including raw data\nraw_plot <- ggplot() + \n  geom_jitter(data = plant_task_clean_data, aes(x = watershed, y = stem_length), \n              alpha = 0.1, position = position_jitter(0.2)) + #raw data\n  geom_pointrange(data = plant_sum, aes(x = watershed, y = mean, \n                                      ymin = mean-sd, ymax = mean+sd))\n\ncowplot::plot_grid(mean_plot, raw_plot, ncol = 2, align = \"v\")\n\n```\n\n\n## Scatter plot {.unnumbered}\n\nA [scatterplot](https://r-graph-gallery.com/scatterplot) displays the relationship between 2 numeric variables. For each data point, the value of its first variable is represented on the X axis, the second on the Y axis\n\nTo create a scatterplot, use the `geom_point()` function within ggplot.\n\n```{r scatter}\n\nplant_task_clean_data %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = stem_length, y = stem_dry_mass)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n```\n\nTo create a scatterplot by group, include a colour or shape level within ggplot.\n\n```{r scatter2}\n\ncolor_plot <- plant_task_clean_data %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = stem_length, y = stem_dry_mass, colour = watershed)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nshape_plot <- plant_task_clean_data %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = stem_length, y = stem_dry_mass, shape = watershed)) +\n  geom_point()\n\ncowplot::plot_grid(color_plot, shape_plot, ncol = 1, align = \"v\")\n\n```\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n## Tweaking plots {.unnumbered}\n\nTo make your figures publication ready, here are some advice on changing the labels, adding colour, changing the shape and size, plotting multiple plots.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills}\n\n## Themes {.unnumbered}\n\nggplot has some default themes you can use for your figures instead of manually changing each feature. Here is what the themes look like when you apply them.\n\n![](images/visualization-themes.png)\n\n\n## Labels and titles {.unnumbered}\n\nTo add a labels independently for the title using `ggtitle()`, subtitle using `ggsubtitle()`, x-axis label using `xlab()`, y-axis label using `ylab()`, or all within the `labs()` function as shown here:\n\n```{r labels}\n\nplant_task_clean_data %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = watershed, y = stem_length)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  # Modify here\n  labs(title = \"Your title\",\n       subtitle = \"your subtile\",\n       x = \"Treatment\", \n       #x = NULL, # You can also remove labels by calling NULL\n       y = \"Stem length (mm)\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\n```\nMore options can be found [here](https://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-title-main-axis-and-legend-titles) such as changing the size and colour of the text, or spliting long titles into multiple lines.\n\n## Shapes, colours, and size {.unnumbered}\n\nTo manually change the point shapes, use the `scale_shape_manual()` function, and choose the shape with it's associated number. More options such as shape size can be found [here](https://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-point-shapes).\n\n![](images/points-symbols.png)\n\n```{r shape}\n\nplant_task_clean_data %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = stem_length, y = stem_dry_mass, shape = watershed)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  # Modify here\n  scale_shape_manual(values = c(4, 15))+\n  labs(x = \"Stem length (mm)\", \n       y = \"Stem dry mass (g)\",\n       shape = \"Watershed\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\n```\n\nThere is a vast number of R libraries that that are tailored to create pretty palettes. You can explore them in your own time. Here is an R package called [`colorspace`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/colorspace/vignettes/colorspace.html) which I like to use often.\n\nYou can change the outline or fill colour overall or by groups (e.g. watershed) with either method below. Note, you can either use existing [R base colour](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2020-04/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf) like `tomato1`, specific R package color names, or hex values (e.g. #000000 for black) for very specific colours.\n\n```{r color}\n\nsingle_colour <- plant_task_clean_data %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = watershed, y = stem_length)) +\n  geom_boxplot(colour = \"darkred\") + # Modify here\n  labs(subtitle = \"Change a single outline colour\",\n       x = \"Treatment\", \n       y = \"Stem length (mm)\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\nsingle_fill <- plant_task_clean_data %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = watershed, y = stem_length)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"#F5C4B8\") + # Modify here\n  labs(subtitle = \"Change a single fill colour\",\n       x = \"Treatment\", \n       y = \"Stem length (mm)\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\ngroup_colour <- plant_task_clean_data %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = watershed, y = stem_length, colour = watershed)) + # Modify here\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  # Modify here\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"darkblue\", \"darkred\")) +\n  labs(subtitle = \"Change outline colour by group\",\n       x = \"Treatment\", \n       y = \"Stem length (mm)\",\n       colour = \"Watershed\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\ngroup_fill <- plant_task_clean_data %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = watershed, y = stem_length, fill = watershed)) + # Modify here\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  # Modify here\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#B8CEF5\", \"#F5C4B8\")) +\n  labs(subtitle = \"Change fill colour by group\",\n       x = \"Treatment\", \n       y = \"Stem length (mm)\",\n       fill = \"Watershed\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\ncowplot::plot_grid(single_colour, single_fill, \n                   group_colour, group_fill, ncol = 2, align = \"v\")\n\n\n```\n\nYou can also colour by gradient if the colour values are continuous. Here is an example with a scatter plot.\n\n\n```{r color2}\n\ncat_plot <- plant_task_clean_data %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = stem_length, y = stem_dry_mass, colour = watershed)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  # Modify here\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"#B8CEF5\", \"#F5C4B8\")) +\n  labs(subtitle = \"Fill by categorical group\",\n       x = \"Stem length (mm)\", \n       y = \"Stem dry mass (g)\",\n       colour = \"Watershed\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\ncon_plot <- plant_task_clean_data %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = stem_length, y = stem_dry_mass, colour = leaf_dry_mass)) +\n  geom_point() +\n    labs(subtitle = \"Fill by continuous value\",\n       x = \"Stem length (mm)\", \n       y = \"Stem dry mass (g)\",\n       colour = \"Leaf dry mass (g)\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\ncowplot::plot_grid(cat_plot, con_plot, ncol = 1, align = \"v\")\n\n```\n\n\n## Splitting plots {.unnumbered}\n\nThe [facet](https://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-facet-split-a-plot-into-a-matrix-of-panels) approach partitions a plot into a matrix of panels. Each panel shows a different subset of the data. Let's seperate out plant_task_clean_data by `year` using the `facet_grid()` function.\n\n\n```{r split}\n\n# Split in vertical direction\nplant_task_clean_data %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = stem_length, y = stem_dry_mass, colour = watershed)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"#B8CEF5\", \"#F5C4B8\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Stem length (mm)\", \n       y = \"Stem dry mass (g)\",\n       colour = \"Watershed\") + \n  theme_classic() +\n  # Modify here\n  facet_grid(year ~ .)\n\n\n# Split in horizontal direction\nplant_task_clean_data %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = stem_length, y = stem_dry_mass, colour = watershed)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"#B8CEF5\", \"#F5C4B8\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Stem length (mm)\", \n       y = \"Stem dry mass (g)\",\n       colour = \"Watershed\") + \n  theme_classic() +\n  # Modify here\n  facet_grid(. ~ year)\n\n```\n\nFacets can be placed side by side using the function `facet_wrap()` as followed. Here, we switch to have the years coloured and the plot split by watershed. How you decide which variable to split and colour will depend on your story and hypothesis.\n\n```{r wrap}\n\nplant_task_clean_data %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = stem_length, y = stem_dry_mass, colour = factor(year))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"#B8CEF5\", \"#F5C4B8\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Stem length (mm)\", \n       y = \"Stem dry mass (g)\",\n       colour = \"Watershed\") + \n  theme_classic() +\n  # Modify here\n  facet_wrap(~ watershed)\n\n```\n\n\nIf you have different types of plots you would like to join together, the R package **cowplot** does a good job of this. More details on cowplot can be found [here](https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/articles/aligning_plots.html), but here is a taste of how to use cowplot. The figure legends are position at the bottom to look nicer using `theme(legend.position=\"bottom\")`.\n\n\n```{r cowplot}\n\ncowplot::plot_grid(group_fill + theme(legend.position = \"bottom\"), \n                   cat_plot + theme(legend.position = \"bottom\"), \n                   ncol = 2, align = \"v\")\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n# Assessment {.unnumbered}\n\nTask to complete before the end of the workshop.\n\nLoad you R file from week 2 that contained your `plant_task_data_clean`.\nUnder the header “*Week 4 workshop - Descriptive statistics*”, complete the following tasks:\n\n**1.

While, you may not not use the whole time series dataset for your study, it could useful to visualise the study period and highlight where you took your samples (e.g. using [`geom_vline()`](https://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-add-straight-lines-to-a-plot-horizontal-vertical-and-regression-lines).\n\nHere is a dataset called `winter_clim_dat.csv` that includes outside (EXT) and inside (DEEP) cave air temperature and humidity of two sites (MAM, YES). \nUsing everything we learnt today, you can create a figure like this using the [`geom_line()`](https://r-graph-gallery.com/279-plotting-time-series-with-ggplot2.html) function and separating temperature and humidity by location (EXT, DEEP) and site (MAM, YES).\n\nThe code below also includes ways of converting raw date values into meaningful values that R can interpret correctly (with [`as.POSIXct()`](https://rpubs.com/lexieorr34/943733) function).
