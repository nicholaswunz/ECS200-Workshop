You’ll be writing your first lines of R code and importing data today!\n\n# Before we start {.unnumbered}\n\nThis step can be skipped if you have R and Rstudio already downloaded and installed.\n\n### Murdoch computer {.unnumbered}\n\nAll Murdoch computers have R and Rstudio available. Login to your account and access Rstudio on your work computer.\n\n### Your own computer {.unnumbered}\n\nIf you are using your own personal computer in this unit, here are the steps for downloading and installing R and Rstudio.\n\n1. **Install R**\n   - Go to [https://cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org)\n   - Choose your operating system and follow the instructions to install.\n\n2. **Install RStudio**\n   - Go to [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)\n   - Download the free version of RStudio Desktop.\n   - Install it on your computer.\n\n# Step 1: Open RStudio {.unnumbered}\n\nOnce you have opened RStudio, you are introduced to the interface where you can see four panels:\n\n- **Console**: Where commands run.\n- **Source**: Where you write and save your code.\n- **Environment/History**: See your datasets and objects (variables) and previous commands (“History” tab).\n- **Plots/Packages/Help/Files**: View graphs and manage tools. You can also use the “Files” tab to navigate and set the working directory. The “Plots” tab will show the output of any plots generated. In “Packages” you will see what packages are actively loaded, or you can attach installed packages. “Help” will display help files for R functions and packages. “Viewer” will allow you to view local web content (e.g. HTML outputs).\n\n\n![**Fig. 1**.

In our case, determining how many species from different taxa have been recorded in Perth Here’s an example, which you can copy, paste and edit into your new script and change the content:\n\n```{r first}\n\n# Week 1 workshop - Getting started\n# Getting familiar with R and load a file\n# Written by Nicholas Wu, 06/11/2024, Murdoch University\n\n```\n\nThe # (hash/pound) is to tell R to not run this line of text. i.e., the comment will not be evaluated.\nTypically, the # is used to annotate or give explanation for what the code is doing.\n\n**Note**: Comment often and in detail. Someone should be able to understand what you did and why. Including your future self.\n\nLet’s try typing and running some code:\n\n```{r example, eval=FALSE}\n\n# Create a variable: number of frogs counted at a pond\nfrogs <- 18\n\n# Add 5 frogs observed the next day\nfrogs_total <- frogs + 5\n\n# Print result\nfrogs_total\n\n```\n\nHere, you can created a new object `frogs` with the assignment operator \"[<-](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6140694/is-there-a-technical-difference-between-and)\". **object_name <- value**\n\nTry this one too:\n\n```{r leaf, eval=FALSE}\n# Mean leaf size of 5 Eucalyptus trees (cm²)\nleaf_sizes <- c(23.4, 21.8, 25.1, 19.7, 22.5)\n\n# Calculate the average leaf size using the mean() function\nmean(leaf_sizes)\n```\n\nYou can combine multiple elements into a [vector](https://www.w3schools.com/r/r_vectors.asp)[^1] with `c()`.\n\n[^1]: A vector is simply a list of items that are of the same type.\n\n### Exercise (1 min) {.unnumbered}\n\n🧪 **Challenge: How would you find the largest leaf size?**\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Show answer</strong></summary>\n\n```{r ans1, eval=FALSE}\nmax(leaf_sizes)\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n# Step 3: Loading Packages {.unnumbered}\n\n![](images/base_import.png)\n\nThe next few lines of code usually load the packages you will be needing for your analysis.\nA **package** is a bundle of commands that can be loaded into R to provide extra functionality. \nFor example, you might load a package for formatting data, or for making maps.\n\nTo install a package, type `install.packages(\"package-name\")`. \nYou only need to install packages once, so in this case you can type directly in the console box, rather than saving the line in your script and re-installing the package every time.\n\nOnce installed, you just need to load the packages using `library(package-name)`.\nHere, we will load the most common packages we will be using in this unit.\n\nThe next lines of code should define your **working directory**. This is a folder on your computer where R will look for data, save your plots, etc. \nTo make your workflow easier, it is good practice to save everything related to one project in the same place, as it will save you a lot of time typing up computer paths or hunting for files that got saved R-knows-where. \n\nFor instance, you could save your script and all the data for this tutorial in a folder called “Intro_to_R”. (It is good practice to avoid spaces in file names as it can sometimes confuse R.) For bigger projects, consider having a root folder with the name of the project (e.g. “My_PhD”) as your working directory, and other folders nested within to separate data, scripts, images, etc. (e.g. My_PhD/Chapter_1/data, My_PhD/Chapter_1/plots, My_PhD/Chapter_2/data, etc.)\n\nTo find out where your working directory is now, run the code `getwd()`. If you want to change it, you can use `setwd()`. Set your working directory to the folder you just downloaded from GitHub:\n\n\n```{r packages, eval=FALSE}\n# Install packages using the install.packages() function.\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n# Load the tidyverse package\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# This is an example filepath. Change the quoted area to your own filepath\nsetwd(\"C:/User/CC-1-RBasics-master\")\n```\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\n## Note\nThere are quotation marks when installing a package, but not when loading it.\n\n:::\n\n\n# Step 4: Loading Files {.unnumbered}\n\nImagine we’ve collected leaf-trait data to look at the growth of seedlings from **untreated** (control) and **calcium-treated** sites. The additional calcium is hypothesised to increase the growth of the seedlings.\nThe file is called `plant_calcium.csv` from the GitHub page.\nThe original data with background explanation of the study is linked [here](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/articles/hbr_maples_vignette.html).\n\n\nFirst, save the file from the [GitHub](https://github.com/nicholaswunz/ECS200) page to your RStudio project folder (wherever you set your directory).\n\n```{r load data, eval=FALSE}\n# Load a CSV file\nplant_calcium_data <- read_csv(\"C:/Users/75002992/OneDrive - Murdoch University/Teaching/ECS200 - Research Methods in Ecology/ECS200 - Workshop/data/plant_calcium.csv\")\n\n# View the first few rows\nhead(plant_calcium_data)\n\n# Displays the last rows\ntail(plant_calcium_data) \n\n # Tells you whether the variables are continuous, integers, categorical or characters\nstr(plant_calcium_data)                \n\n```\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\n## Note\nRemember to save your script once in a while! If you haven’t saved it already, why not save it in the same directory as the rest of the tutorial file, and give it a meaningful name.\n\n:::\n\n\n# Step 5: Exploring the Data {.unnumbered}\n\n`str(object.name)` is a great command that shows the structure of your data ([atomic class](https://resbaz.github.io/2014-r-materials/lessons/01-intro_r/data-structures.html)). So often, analyses in R go wrong because R decides that a variable is a certain type of data that it is not. \nFor instance, you might have four study groups that you simply called “1, 2, 3, 4”, and while you know that it should be a categorical grouping variable (i.e. a **factor**), R might decide that this column contains **numeric** (numbers) or **integer** (whole number or count) data. \nIf your study groups were called “one, two, three, four”, R might decide it’s a **character** variable (words or strings of words), which will not get you far if you want to compare means among groups. \nBottom line: always check your data structure!\n\n| Class     | Description                                                               | Examples                                    | Use                                  |\n|:---------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------:|\n| numeric   | These are numbers that can take any value within a range (continuous).    | 3.14, -2.5, 100.5                           | Height, weight, temperature.         |\n| integers  | Whole numbers without decimal points.                                     | 1, 10, 100, 0, -42                          | Counting items, indexing.            |\n| factors   | Variables that take on a limited number of distinct values (categorical). | \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\" or \"male\", \"female\" | Grouping data, statistical modeling. |\n| character | Text data.                                                                | \"apple\", \"hello world\"                      | Names, labels, descriptions.         |\n\n\n\nYou can see that when you run `str(plant_calcium_data)`, each column has the name of the varliable and the class type next to them. e.g. `year` is a *num* class (numeric), `elevation` is a *chr* class (character) etc.\n\n\nYou’ll notice the `watershed` variable shows as a character variable, but it should be a factor (categorical variable) consisting of a *reference* (untreated) category and a *W1* (calcium-trated) category, so we’ll force it to be one. \nWhen you want to access just one column of a data frame, you append the variable name to the object name with a dollar $sign. \nThis syntax lets you see, modify, and/or reassign this variable.\n\n```{r dollar, eval=FALSE}\n\n# Displays the first few rows of this column only (the reference group)\nhead(plant_calcium_data$watershed)\n\n# Tells you what type of variable we're dealing with: it's character now but we want it to be a factor\nclass(plant_calcium_data$watershed)\n\n# What are we doing here?!\nplant_calcium_data$watershed <- as.factor(plant_calcium_data$watershed)\n\n```\n\nIn that last line of code, the `as.factor(`) function turns whatever values you put inside into a factor (here, we specified we wanted to transform the character values in the `watershed` column from the edidiv object). \nHowever, if you were to run just the bit of code on the right side of the arrow, it would work that one time, but would not modify the data stored in the object. \nBy assigning with the arrow the output of the function to the variable, the original `plant_calcium_data$watershed` in fact gets overwritten : the transformation is stored in the object. \nTry again to run `class(plant_calcium_data$watershed)` - what do you notice?\n\n```{r more, eval=FALSE}\n# More exploration\n\n# Displays number of rows and columns\ndim(plant_calcium_data)\n\n# Gives you a summary of the data\nsummary(plant_calcium_data)\n\n # Gives you a summary of that particular variable (column) in your dataset\nsummary(plant_calcium_data$watershed) \n\n```\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\n## Note\n\nWhenever you see an error like this:\n\n```{r library error, eval=FALSE}\n#| eval: false\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n#> Error in library(ggrepel) : there is no package called ‘ggrepel’\n```\n\nYou need to run `install.packages(\"ggrepel\")` to install the package.\n\n:::\n\n\n# Assessment 1 {.unnumbered}\n\nTask to complete before the end of the workshop.\n\n1. Create and manipulate variables:\n\n- Create a variable called `birds` and assign it a value (e.g., number of birds seen).\n- Create another variable called `sites` and a value between 2 and 10.\n- Add a third observation and multiple `birds` and `sites` to get the result in a new variable `birds_total`.\n\n\n2. Work with vectors:\n\n- Create a vector called `tree_heights` with ten numeric values, or generate.\n- Find the average tree height using the base R function.\n- Find the minimum tree height using the base R function.\n\n3. Set a new R script working directory:\n\n- Create a new R script and include the header with the workshop name, the main goal and your name and date for the next workshop.\n- Load the `tidyverse` package.\n- set up your directory.\n- Load the `plant_calcium.csv`.\n\nWe will use this new R script for the next workshop.\n\n**Note**: You can use Google and ChatGPT to find the appropriate function. \nIn the real world, you won't be remembering every single function, but your skills in finding and using the right function will greatly help your career. \nIn your future job, don't just blindly cut and paste code to your R script. \nUnderstand why the code is presented and if it is relevent to your task. \nI've noticed AI models sometimes give extra code or takes unncessesary steps to get to the answer. Be efficient and comfortable with your code.\n\n\n## For the adventurous folks {.unnumbered}\n\nFor those comfortable with R and coding and would like an additional challenge. Here is a task for you before the next week. \n\n- Create a vector `tree_heights` with 100 numeric values between 0-50 using the R random number generator. \n- Find the quartile range of the from the `tree_heights`vector.\n\n\n```{r answer, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}\n\n# sample.int will generate 100 random numbers from the range 1–50. The replace = TRUE which samples with replacing the previous generated number (i.e independent):\ntree_heights <- sample(1:50, 100, replace = TRUE)\n\nquantile(tree_heights).\n\n```\n\n# Part 2 - Quality Check {.unnumbered}\n\n>All statistical techniques have in common the problem of ‘*rubbish in, rubbish out*’\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to check the quality of the raw data you imported, and steps to correct errors in the raw data.\n\n![](images/base_tidy.png)\n\n## Background reading {.unnumbered}\n\nHow do we know the data is ready for analysis? \nBefore we do any analysis, we need to check the raw data for the following:\n\n- **Check data structure and types**: Use `str()` and `summary()` to ensure each column is the correct type (numeric, factor, character, etc.) and matches your expectations. e.g., Convert relevant character columns to factors for categorical analysis.\n- **Inspect for missing values**: Use `colSums(is.na()` or visual tools (e.g., `naniar::gg_miss_var()` or `visdat_viz_dat()`) to identify missing data and decide how to handle it.\n- **Check for duplicates**: Ensure there are no unintended duplicate rows or IDs.\n- **Validate categorical variables**: Confirm that categories are consistent and correctly formatted (e.g., all lower case, no extra spaces).\n- **Scan for outliers or impossible values**: Look for values outside expected ranges (e.g., negative stem lengths, impossible dates).\n- **Review column names**: Ensure column names are meaningful, have no spaces or special characters, and are consistent.\n- **Preview the data**: Use plotting functions to visually inspect the data for obvious issues.\n- **Check for extra rows or columns**: Sometimes, files have summary rows, notes, or empty columns that should be removed.\n\nThese steps help ensure your data is reliable, interpretable, and suitable for statistical analysis. Importantly, it makes you a trustworthy researcher!\n\n# Before we start {.unnumbered}\n\nClick **File > New File > R Script** to start. Write the workshop name, the main goal and your name and date.

Initial check {.unnumbered}\n\nThis helps you spot if variables are coded incorrectly (e.g., numbers as characters or vice versa), which could be due to the researcher error before inporting the data.\nSome example mistakes include:\n  \n- **Incorrect data types**: Numeric columns may be read as character (text) if there are unexpected symbols, missing values coded inconsistently, or formatting issues (**e.g.** a column meant to be numbers may contain text or empty strings, causing R to treat it as character instead of numeric). \n- **Inconsistent coding**: Categorical variables may be inconsistently labeled (**e.g.**, \"Male\", \"male\", \"M\"), leading to multiple categories that should be merged.\n- **Header issues**: Sometimes, the header row is missing or duplicated, or extra non-data rows are included at the top or bottom of the file.\n- **Encoding problems**: Special characters (e.g., accents, non-English letters) may not display correctly if the file encoding is not specified or mismatched.\n- **Trailing spaces**: Spaces at the start or end of strings can create unexpected categories or prevent proper matching.\n\n![](images/check_initial.png)\n\n\nFor small datasets (like in this workshop) it is easier to make fixes directly from Excel and import the new .csv file.\nAs before, we will check the data here first with the `str()` function.\n\n```{r inital check 2, eval=FALSE}\n\n# Check the structure of your data\nstr(plant_data)\n\n# Get a summary of all variables\nsummary(plant_data)\n\n```\n\n\n### Exercise (5 min) {.unnumbered}\n\n🧪 **Find the incorrect class in this dataset**\n  \nI have created an example dataset called `fake_data` with three things wrong with it. \nFind the three issues in this dataset.\n\n```{r ex 2}\nfake_data <- data.frame(\n  site = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"a\", \"B\", \"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\", \"C\", \"C\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"C\", \"C\"),\n  species_1 = c(7, 25, 30, 50, 38, 13, 5, 31, 34, 22, 41, 25, 22, 37, 39, 13, 45, 10, 40, 7, 28, 36, 19, 2, 12, 5, 16, 38, 27, 44, 44),\n  species_2 = c(9.3, 8.6, 0.8 , 7.5, 9 , 9.1, 4.3, 8.6, 0.1, 7.8, 1.2, 6.2, 0.4, 0.4, 7.4, 1.9, 8.3, 7.8, 2.9, 9.3, 9.1, 2.3, 6.3, 8.5, 6.5, 6.6, \"1,7\", 1.8, 8.4, 4.7, 4.7),\n  species_3 = c(190, 160, 70, 430, 310, 99, 530, 420, 371, 357, 198, 171, 463, 124, 254, 484, 435, 409, 122, 305, 410, 162, 473, 200, 401, 273, 421, 419, 293, 487, 487),\n  species_4 = c(2, 0, 4, 8, 6.7, 3, 7.2, 4.3, 2, NA, 10, 10, 6, 4, 8, 1.7, 1, 0, NA, 4, 6, 8.2, 10, 6, 2, 5, 10, 7, NA, NA, NA)\n)\n\n```\n\n\nWhat are the identified issues?\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Show answer</strong></summary>\n\n1. site should be **factor**, not character\n2. species_2 should be **numeric**, not character\n3. species_4 has **5 NA's**\n\n</details>\n\n## 1.2.

Check for duplicates {.unnumbered}\n\n![](images/check_duplicate.png)\n\nThere are two common duplicate types that can happen in your dataset.\n\n1. **Row duplicates**: where the values and names of two rows are identical 99% of the time, this is user error (e.g. copy pasted). \nThese must be identified and removed.\n\n```{r dup 1, eval=FALSE}\n\nsum(duplicated(plant_data))  # Returns the number of duplicate rows\n\n# View the duplicate rows themselves\nplant_data[duplicated(plant_data), ]\n\n```\nIn the `plant_data`, there are no row duplicates.\n\n2. **Value duplicates**: 90% of value duplicates in a column might be biologically realistic responses and is likely due to rounding of values during recording (e.g. values 2.5 and 2.5 might look duplicated due to user rounding. Actual values are 2.47 and 2.49). \nThis is usually okay and can be kept in the dataset. \nUser error occurs if there is a pattern in duplicates (e.g. **2**,**2**,6,1,**2**,**2**,9,4,**2**,**2**,5,9). \nThis can occur due to copy and pasting in the following row by accident.\n\nYou the researcher must decide whether these duplicate responses are real or due to user error.\n\n```{r dup 2, eval=FALSE}\n\nsum(duplicated(plant_data$leaf_dry_mass))  # Returns the number of duplicate rows\n\nplant_data[duplicated(plant_data$leaf_dry_mass) | duplicated(plant_data$leaf_dry_mass, fromLast = TRUE), ] # Returns all occurrences of duplicated numbers \n\n```\nIn the `leaf_dry_mass` column, there are 51 value duplicates.\n\n### Exercise (3 min) {.unnumbered}\n\n🧪 **Identify the duplicate row in the `fake_data` dataset**\n  \n- Where is the duplicate row?\n- Remove the duplicate row.

See a more comprehensive [page](https://statsandr.com/blog/outliers-detection-in-r/) for more options. \nHere, we will create two common plots to check for outliers, and run some simple methods for detecting and removing outliers.\n\n### Boxplot {.unnumbered}\n\nWe can use the `ggplot()` function from the [`ggplot`](https://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-essentials) package to create a boxplot via `geom_boxplot()` showing the distribution of the `lead2area` data.\n\n```{r boxplot}\n\n# Boxplot of leaf2area to detect potential outliers\nggplot(plant_data, aes(y = leaf2area)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n```\n\n### Histogram {.unnumbered}\n\nAnother way we can visualise outliers is with histograms via `geom_histogram()` or density plots via [`geom_density()`](https://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-density-plot-quick-start-guide-r-software-and-data-visualization)\n\n```{r hist}\n\n# Boxplot of height to detect potential outliers\nggplot(plant_data, aes(x = leaf2area)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n```\n\nHere you can see one clear outlier with a value above 100. All other values are below 25.\nYou can either manually remove the outlier on Excel, or with the following code below.\n\n**Option**: Remove outliers using the interquartile range (IQR) rule.\n\n```{r outier, eval=FALSE}\n\n# View potential outliers using IQR rule\nQ1 <- quantile(plant_data$leaf2area, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)\nQ3 <- quantile(plant_data$leaf2area, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)\nIQR <- Q3 - Q1\n\n# Filter rows with height outside 1.5 * IQR range\noutliers <- filter(plant, height < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR) | height > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))\noutliers\n\n```\n\nMake sure the numbers are biologically realistic based on intuition and comparing with the literature.\nIf the values are unrealistic, it is a safe assumption to remove them.\n\n## 2.2 Is the data normally distributed {.unnumbered}\n\nThis step is required to check if the data is suitable for certain types of analysis.\nSometimes, [transformation](week2_tidy_data.qmd) is required for certain data to meet the assumptions of certain statistical methods and improve the interpretability and performance of models.\nMany statistical techniques—like linear regression, ANOVA, and t-tests—assume that the data is normally distributed, has constant variance, and is linearly related (from your [MAS183 - Statistical Data Analysis](https://handbook.murdoch.edu.au/units/18/MAS183) and [MAS224 - Biostatistical Methods](https://handbook.murdoch.edu.au/units/02/mas224) units).\nIf the data is skewed, has outliers, or shows non-constant variance (heteroscedasticity), these assumptions are violated, which can lead to **biased estimates, incorrect conclusions, or poor model fit**.\n\nBy applying transformations such as logarithmic, square root, or Box-Cox, we can:\n  \n- **Reduce skewness** and make the distribution more symmetrical.\n- **Stabilise variance** across levels of an independent variable.\n- **Improve linearity** between variables.\n- **Minimise the influence of outliers**.\n\n\nLet's check the distribution of `leaf2area` after removing that one outlier.\n\n```{r normal}\n\n# remove values above 100\nplant_data_clean <- plant_data %>%\n  filter(leaf2area < 100)\n\nggplot(plant_data_clean, aes(x = leaf2area)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n```\n\nLooks normally distributed to me! We will learn data transformation in next weeks workshop.\n\n\n# Assessment 2 {.unnumbered}\n\nTask to complete before the end of the workshop.\n\nWe will use a modified `plant_calcium.csv` dataset called `plant_calcium_task.csv` for the next workshop. \nHere, you need to conduct a quality check and data exploration of this new dataset and fix any potential issues.\n\nTo make it a bit easier for you, I have given you hints where the errors are so you dont have to look through every single column or every problem.\nBut in your own dataset, you will need to thoroughly check your own data in the future. \n\nHints:\n  \n1. Identify **missing values** in one of the numeric columns. Remember to check if you really need to remove these missing value rows or not.\n2. There is an **inconsistent coding** in one of the categorical variables. Correct the incorrect coding. You can do this on Excel, or from R (see adventurous folks section).\n3. There are **two numeric columns** with outliers. One is biologically realistic, the other one is a data entry mistake. Decide which one is the data entry mistake and remove/correct that outlier.\n4. Create a **clean version** of the data after removing the errors as `plant_task_data_clean` and **visualise** one of the numeric columns as a density plot.\n\nRemember to create a header with the next workshop titled \"Week 3 workshop - Tidying data\", a description called \"Tidy data through transformation and filtering\", your name, and the next workshops date.\n\n\n```{r home ans 2, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}\n\n# 1. values missing in 'sample' column.\n# 2. 'watershed' column - W2 should be W1\n# 3. 'stem_dry_mass' one biologically unrealistic row 327, and 'leaf_dry_mass' one biologically realistic in row 322\n\n```\n\n\n## For the adventurous folks {.unnumbered}\n\nHere we will start thinking about writing code efficiently.\nFor example, you would have noticed by now that whatever raw data we load in R, any categorical columns are automatically listed as characters. \nSo you can write a code that both loads the data and change the characters to factors in the same line of code (e.g. using the `dplyr::mutate()` function).\nLoad the `plant_calcium_task.csv` and change categorical variables from character and factor.\n\nRepeat the same assessment as above, but instead of correcting the errors by editing them on Excel, do all the corrections within the R environment. Visualise the **clean version** of the the data with a density plot but separate the density by the treatment groups (reference and W1 variables). \n\n\n# Extra Stuff {.unnumbered}\n\n## Why is my code not working! {.unnumbered}\n\nComputers are only as smart as the humans that use them.\n\nIf your code is not working there is most likely a spelling mistake or a typographic error. These human errors are easy to miss but equally easy to fix!\n  \nIf your code is not working take a moment to breathe. Then check for common, minor errors such as:\n  \n- Spelling mistakes\n- Wrong dataset name\n- Wrong variable (column) name\n- Missing or wrong quotation mark\n- Missing bracket\n- Inconsistent cases (e.g. Uppercase)\n- Missed a step\n- Invalid syntax (e.g. spaces)\n- Duplicates of the same function with multiple errors – keep your scripts tidy!\n- These reading/typing mistakes are the majority of encountered errors. They are not a big deal and are easily corrected.\n\nYou can and should easily fix the above mistakes yourself!\nWe want you to know how to work problems out independently.\n\n\n### Exercise {.unnumbered}\n\n🧪 **Why does this code not work?**\n\n```{r code error, eval=FALSE}\nmy_variable <- 10\nmy_varıable\n#> Error: object 'my_varıable' not found\n```\n\nLook carefully! (This may seem like an exercise in pointlessness, but training your brain to notice even the tiniest difference will pay off when programming.)\n\n## Additional resource {.unnumbered}\n\n- Loading
