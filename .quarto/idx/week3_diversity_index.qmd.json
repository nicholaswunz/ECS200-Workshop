This section is particularly important for groups who are doing field studies, but this quantitative skill is also useful if you have a job in field ecology.\n\n![](images/biodiversity.jpg)\n\n\n## Background reading {.unnumbered}\n\nBiodiversity can be measured using different scales and metrics, most commonly by looking at species richness (the number of different species) and species evenness (the relative proportion of individuals in each species). Other measurements include alpha, beta, and gamma diversity, which describe diversity within a single site, between sites, and across a larger region, respectively. Here, we will focus on the most common ways of quantifying diversity and abundance. \n\n\n**Abundance metrics**\n\n1. [Absolute abundance](#absolute) ($N_i$): The total number of individuals of a species recorded. \nA simple and intuitive calculation, but sensitive to sampling effort, i.e, cannot compare across surveys without standardisation. \nOnly use when sampling effort is standardised (e.g., same transect length, trap nights).\n\n2. [Relative abundance](#relative) ($p_i$): Comparable across communities and is foundational for many diversity indices. \nOnly use when communities have differing total abundance, or you need proportional representation, or over time.\n\n3. [Density](#density) ($d_i$; individuals per area or effort): Allows spatial comparison, but requires accurate area/effort estimates. \nAppropriate for quadrat/plot/transect sampling.\n\n**Species richness metrics**\n\n1. [Species richness](#richness) ($S$): The total number of unique species.\nA sample and intuitive calculation, but highly sensitive to sample size and rare species.\nOnly use when comparing equally-sampled plots or as a component in more complex metrics.\n\n\n2. [Rarefied richness](#rare): Standardised species richness for a fixed number of individuals or samples.\nAllows fair comparison across unequal sampling effort, but assumes random sampling, i.e low resolution when sample sizes differ greatly.\nOnly use in surveys with unequal effort.\n\n\n**Diversity indices**\n\n1. [Shannon diversity index](#shannon) ($H'$): Incorporates both species richness and evenness (the relative abundance of each species).\n**Widely used**, but difficult to interpret ecologically.\nModerately sensitive to rare species, but good for comparing diversity across sites or time when both abundance and richness matter.\n\n2. [Simpson's diversity index](#simpson) ($D$): Emphasises the dominance of species and is less sensitive to rare species.\nHowever, underweights rare species and may mask losses in low-abundance taxa.\nUse in management-focused studies (dominance effects), and stable community comparisons.\n\nOther types of diversity metrics such as Rényi and Tsallis diversities, taxonomic diversity and taxonomic distinctness, alpha and beta diveristy can also be done with the [`vegan`](https://vegandevs.r-universe.dev/vegan/doc/diversity-vegan.pdf) R package.\n\n\n### New functions {.unnumbered}\n\nHere are some new functions from the tidyverse you will be using in this workshop.\n\n- `pivot_longer()` converts data from *wide format* to *long format*.\n- `starts_with()`*used inside `select()` to choose columns whose names begin with a specific string.\n- `across()`* applies a function to multiple columns in a `summarise()` or `mutate()` call. e.g. `everything()` = select all columns and `sum` = function to apply.\n- `.x`* is a pronoun used inside anonymous functions in tidyverse pipelines—especially in `across()` and `map()`. It represents the current column being processed.\n\n'*' See 'Relative abundance' section for example use.\n\n\n## Calculations of abundance {.unnumbered}\n\nWe will start with this fake ecological survey data. Also, to calculate Shannon and Simpson's diversity, we will need the the `vegan` package.\n\n```{r fake, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\n#install.packages('vegan')\n\n# Load library\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(vegan)\n\n# Create fake survey data\nfake_data <- data.frame(\n  site = c(\"A\",\"A\",\"A\",\"A\",\"A\",\n           \"B\",\"B\",\"B\",\"b\",\"B\",\n           \"C\",\"C\",\"C\",\"C\",\"C\"),\n  species_1 = c(57,73,20,75,83,\n                41,6,61,45,2,\n                0,93,0,0,86),\n  species_2 = c(31,12,4,41,4,\n                49,2,7,7,9,\n                54,64,35,38,53),\n  species_3 = c(0,38,3,0,39,\n                0,29,24,15,23,\n                10,0,1,5,2),\n  species_4 = c(11,28,19,0,1,\n                34,7,0,1,0,\n                1,0,12,45,5),\n  species_5 = c(0,0,0,0,0,\n                4,5,0,0,0,\n                3,1,0,1,2)\n)\n\n# Clean data identified with incosistencies in format\nfake_data_clean <- fake_data %>%\n  dplyr::mutate(site = recode(site, \"b\" = \"B\"),\n                site = as.factor(site))\n\n```\n\n::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills}\n\n## Absolute abundance {#absolute .unnumbered}\n\n**Equation**:\n\n$$\nN_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} n_{ij}\n$$\nwhere $n_{ij}$ - individuals of species $i$ in sample $j$. \nEssentially its just the number of individuals of that species counted.\n\nTo calculate absolute abundance of one species in R, here is the following code.\n\n```{r abundance, eval=FALSE}\n\n# for one species\nsum(fake_data_clean$species_1) # Total abundance for all or individual species across all sites\n\n```\nYou can see that the total number of species_1 in the survey is 642.\n\nYou may want to calculate abundance for each species, by site.\n\n```{r abundance 2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\n\nfake_data_long <- fake_data_clean %>% \n  tidyr::pivot_longer(!site, names_to = \"species\", values_to = \"abundance\") # convert wide format to long format (easier to summaries groups)\n\nabundance_sum <- fake_data_long %>%\n  group_by(site, species) %>%\n  summarise(total = sum(abundance))\n\n# Visulise abundance\nabundance_sum %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = species, y = total), stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Total abundance\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n```\nYou can see that the total number of species_1 is 308 in site A, 155 in site B, and 179 in site C.\n\n## Relative abundance {#relative .unnumbered}\n\n**Equation**:\n\n$$\np_i = \\frac{N_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{S} N_i} = \\frac{N_i}{N}\n$$\n\nwhere $p_i$ is the relative abundance of species $i$, $N_i$ is the abundance of species $i$, $\\sum_{i=1}^{S} N_i = N$ is the total abundance across all species in the community, $S$ is the total number of species. \n\nFor example, if 10 of the 50 individuals in a quadrat are species A: $p_i$ = 10/50 = 0.20, meaning species A makes up 20% of the community.\n\nTo calculate relative abundance of each species in R, here is the following code.\n\n```{r relative, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\n\n# Option 1 - using wide format data\nfake_data_clean %>%\n  select(starts_with(\"species_\")) %>% # select all columns with \"species_\"\n  summarise(across(everything(), sum)) %>%      # For each column (using across), calculate the sum of all values (everything). i.e total abundance per species\n  mutate(total = sum(across(everything()))) %>% # total abundance of all species\n  mutate(across(starts_with(\"species_\"), ~ .x / total)) # For each species column, take its values (.x) and divide by total.\n\n\n# Option 2 -
