# Welcome {.unnumbered}

The [ECS200 - Research Methods in Ecology](https://handbook.murdoch.edu.au/units/07/ecs200) workshops will go through the steps of a typical data science project that looks something like Figure 1.

![**Fig. 1**. You start with data import and tidying. Next, you understand your data with an iterative cycle of transforming, visualizing, and modeling. You finish the process by communicating your results to other humans.](images/base.png)

First, you must **import** ([week 1](week1_getting_started.qmd)) your data into R.
This usually means loading data stored in a file, database, or web application programming interface (API) into a data frame in R.
If you can't get your data into R, you can't do any data science with it!

Once your data is imported, it’s a good idea to **tidy** ([week 2](week2_tidy_data.qmd)) it.
Tidying means putting it into a consistent format where each column is a variable and each row is an observation.
This alignment between the structure and meaning of the data makes analysis far easier.
Tidy data lets you focus on answering questions rather than reformatting for each new task.

Next, you’ll often **transform** ([week 2](week2_tidy_data.qmd)) your data.
This might include filtering for specific observations (e.g. animals from one site or data from the past year), creating new variables (e.g. calculating speed from distance and time), or summarising patterns (e.g. counts or averages).
Tidying and transforming are often called wrangling, because getting data into a usable form can feel like a struggle!

Once you have tidy, relevant data, you’ll typically turn to two main tools: visualisation and modelling.
These are complementary, and most analyses move back and forth between them.

- **Visualisation** ([week 4](week4_descriptive_stats.qmd)) is fundamental.
A good plot can reveal unexpected patterns or raise new questions.
It might even suggest you’re asking the wrong question or need better data.
Visualisations can be powerful—but they don’t scale well, since they rely on human interpretation.

- **Models** (week 5 to week 12) complement visualisation.
Once you’ve clearly defined your questions, a model can help answer them.
Models are mathematical or computational, so they scale well—and if needed, more computers are easier to get than more people!
However, models come with assumptions and can't question those assumptions or truly surprise you.

The final step in data science is **communication** (visualisation and model weeks).
Even the best models or visuals are useless unless you can clearly explain your findings to others.
Effective communication is critical.

Surrounding all these activities is **programming**.
You’ll use code throughout every step of a data science project.
You don’t need to be a programming expert, but improving your coding skills pays off—it helps you automate tasks and solve problems more efficiently.


## Learning Objectives of the Unit

At the end of the unit, students should be able to:

1. **Design** ecological research using appropriate sampling strategies and analytical methods.
2. Apply appropriate **statistical methods** to test ecological hypotheses.
3. Apply **R programming** to process, analyse, and visualise ecological datasets to professional standards.
4. Critically **evaluate** the strengths and limitations of research designs under different ecological conditions.
5. **Communicate** the findings of ecological research to professional standards.
