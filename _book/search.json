    "text": "Welcome\nWorkshop materials in the github repository ECS200.\nThe ECS200 - Research Methods in Ecology workshops will go through the steps of a typical data science project that looks something like Figure 1.\nFirst, you must import (week 1) your data into R. This usually means loading data stored in a file, database, or web application programming interface (API) into a data frame in R. If you can’t get your data into R, you can’t do any data science with it!\nOnce your data is imported, it’s a good idea to tidy (week 2) it. Tidying means putting it into a consistent format where each column is a variable and each row is an observation. This alignment between the structure and meaning of the data makes analysis far easier. Tidy data lets you focus on answering questions rather than reformatting for each new task.\nNext, you’ll often transform (week 2) your data. This might include filtering for specific observations (e.g. animals from one site or data from the past year), creating new variables (e.g. calculating speed from distance and time), or summarising patterns (e.g. counts or averages). Tidying and transforming are often called wrangling, because getting data into a usable form can feel like a struggle!\nOnce you have tidy, relevant data, you’ll typically turn to two main tools: visualisation and modelling. These are complementary, and most analyses move back and forth between them.\nThe final step in data science is communication (visualisation and model weeks). Even the best models or visuals are useless unless you can clearly explain your findings to others. Effective communication is critical.\nSurrounding all these activities is programming. You’ll use code throughout every step of a data science project. You don’t need to be a programming expert, but improving your coding skills pays off—it helps you automate tasks and solve problems more efficiently.",

    "text": "Design your project\nThe Island is a virtual environment where the original intention was for students to collect data for addressing questions in epidemiology. However, the Island has since been updated to include field stations that allow for plant growth. The plants can represent any plant, either an agriculturally significant plant, an indigenous significant plant, or a species of conservation concern. You decide on what plant it is and how it related to your topic.\nNote, the plants grow in real time, and typically take 14 days to fully grow, depending on the local climate.\nAccess The Island from myMurdoch Learning.\nThere are three islands of focus (Fig. 1):\nAltogether, there are three field stations from three islands with differing climates. Each station has 36 plots.\nYou can manipulate Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) levels in the soil prior to growing the plants. The level of N and P are represented by blacks. Two blocks are the default, so we would consider them normal levels (Fig. 2), no blocks mean no N or P, four blocks means twice the concentration of normal levels, and five blocks is the maximum allowed (represents 2.5 times normal levels). Give the blocks some values. Use realistic values based on the literature and what is considered normal for the plant of interest.\nBecause there are three stations that span across different climates. You can compare the effect of temperature or rainfall on plant growth, fruit production etc. All stations provide the date, maximum temperature in degrees Celsius and rainfall in millimetres (Table 1). You can use this data to correlate with your dependent variables. You have the option to look at the interaction of N or P with temperature or rainfall (factorial design).\nFor the 36 plots per site, it means you can have 18 replicate plots/treatment if you have two treatments, 12 replicate plots/treatment if you have three treatments, 9 replicate plots/treatment if you have four treatments, and 6 replicate plots/treatment if you have five treatments. Balance between number of treatments and number of replicates.",

Often you’ll need to create some new variables or summaries, or maybe you just want to rename the variables or reorder the observations in order to make the data a little easier to work with. In this workshop you are going to learn the five key dplyr functions (part of tidyverse) that allow you to solve the vast majority of your data manipulation challenges:\nThese can all be used in conjunction with group_by() which changes the scope of each function from operating on the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group. These six functions provide the verbs for a language of data manipulation.\nAll verbs work similarly:\nTogether these properties make it easy to chain together multiple simple steps to achieve a complex result.

Initial check\nThis helps you spot if variables are coded incorrectly (e.g., numbers as characters or vice versa), which could be due to the researcher error before inporting the data. Some example mistakes include:\n\nIncorrect data types: Numeric columns may be read as character (text) if there are unexpected symbols, missing values coded inconsistently, or formatting issues (e.g. a column meant to be numbers may contain text or empty strings, causing R to treat it as character instead of numeric).\nInconsistent coding: Categorical variables may be inconsistently labeled (e.g., “Male”, “male”, “M”), leading to multiple categories that should be merged.\nHeader issues: Sometimes, the header row is missing or duplicated, or extra non-data rows are included at the top or bottom of the file.\nEncoding problems: Special characters (e.g., accents, non-English letters) may not display correctly if the file encoding is not specified or mismatched.\nTrailing spaces: Spaces at the start or end of strings can create unexpected categories or prevent proper matching.\n\n\nFor small datasets (like in this workshop) it is easier to make fixes directly from Excel and import the new .csv file.

They can:\n\nSkew statistical results: A single extreme value can pull the mean far from the center, increase variability making data seem more spread than it really us, and can distrort the slope and intercept of linear models, leading to misleading predictions.\nCreate obscure patterns: Hide clusters or trends that would otherwise be visible.\nIndicate user error: Data entry mistakes (e.g., typing 1000 instead of 100), measurement errors (e.g., faulty sensors), incorrect data merging (e.g., mixing units like metres and feet).\n\nThere are different ways we can check for outliers. See a more comprehensive page for more options. Here, we will create two common plots to check for outliers, and run some simple methods for detecting and removing outliers.\n\nBoxplot\nWe can use the ggplot() function from the ggplot package to create a boxplot via geom_boxplot() showing the distribution of the lead2area data.\n\n# Boxplot of leaf2area to detect potential outliers\nggplot(plant_data, aes(y = leaf2area)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\nWarning: Removed 117 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram\nAnother way we can visualise outliers is with histograms via geom_histogram() or density plots via geom_density()\n\n# Boxplot of height to detect potential outliers\nggplot(plant_data, aes(x = leaf2area)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 117 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere you can see one clear outlier with a value above 100. All other values are below 25. You can either manually remove the outlier on Excel, or with the following code below.\nOption: Remove outliers using the interquartile range (IQR) rule.\n\n# View potential outliers using IQR rule\nQ1 &lt;- quantile(plant_data$leaf2area, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)\nQ3 &lt;- quantile(plant_data$leaf2area, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)\nIQR &lt;- Q3 - Q1\n\n# Filter rows with height outside 1.5 * IQR range\noutliers &lt;- filter(plant, height &lt; (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR) | height &gt; (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))\noutliers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDon’t just blindly remove outliers!\n\n\nMake sure the numbers are biologically realistic based on intuition and comparing with the literature. If the values are unrealistic, it is a safe assumption to remove them.",

For example, you would have noticed by now that whatever raw data we load in R, any categorical columns are automatically listed as characters. So you can write a code that both loads the data and change the characters to factors in the same line of code (e.g. using the dplyr::mutate() function). Load the plant_calcium_homework.csv and change categorical variables from character and factor.\nRepeat the same homework as above, but instead of correcting the errors by editing them on Excel, do all the corrections within the R environment. Visualise the clean version of the the data with a density plot but separate the density by the treatment groups (reference and W1 variables).",

    "text": "2.2 Is the data normally distributed\nThis step is required to check if the data is suitable for certain types of analysis. Sometimes, transformation is required for certain data to meet the assumptions of certain statistical methods and improve the interpretability and performance of models. Many statistical techniques—like linear regression, ANOVA, and t-tests—assume that the data is normally distributed, has constant variance, and is linearly related (from your MAS183 - Statistical Data Analysis and MAS224 - Biostatistical Methods units). If the data is skewed, has outliers, or shows non-constant variance (heteroscedasticity), these assumptions are violated, which can lead to biased estimates, incorrect conclusions, or poor model fit.\nBy applying transformations such as logarithmic, square root, or Box-Cox, we can:\n\nReduce skewness and make the distribution more symmetrical.\nStabilise variance across levels of an independent variable.\nImprove linearity between variables.\nMinimise the influence of outliers.\n\nLet’s check the distribution of leaf2area after removing that one outlier.\n\n # remove values above 100\nplant_data_clean &lt;- plant_data %&gt;%\n  filter(leaf2area &lt; 100)\n\nggplot(plant_data_clean, aes(x = leaf2area)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

    "text": "Filter rows with filter()\n\nfilter() allows you to subset observations based on their values. The first argument is the name of the data frame. The second and subsequent arguments are the expressions that filter the data frame. For example, we can select all values for the year 2004 for the calcium-treated sites (W1):\n\n# filter function by two columns. A numeric and a categorical.\nfilter(plant_homework_clean_data, year == 2004, watershed == \"W1\")\n\nYou can also filter rows by more one variable in a column using x %in% y logic. This will select every row where x is one of the values in y. For example, we can select all values in transect R1 and W1-1 only:\n\n# filter function for the transect column by \"R1\" and \"W1-1\"\nfilter(plant_homework_clean_data, transect %in% c(\"R1\", \"W1-1\"))\n\nLastly, you can filter by number thresholds. e.g. filtering out extreme values (i.e. for data quality checks), or filter within a range of values. For example, we can select all stem_dry_mass values below 0.9 or between 0.01-0.02:\n\n# filter function by stem_dry_mass values below 0.9\nfilter(plant_homework_clean_data, stem_dry_mass &lt;= 0.9)\n\n# filter function by stem_dry_mass values between 0.01 and 0.02\nfilter(plant_homework_clean_data, stem_dry_mass &gt; 0.01 & stem_dry_mass &lt; 0.02)\n\nOther possible functions and operators within the filter() function can be found here.",

    "text": "Grouped summaries with summarise()\n\nThe last key verb is summarise(). It collapses a data frame to a single row. However, summarise() is not terribly useful unless we pair it with group_by(). This changes the unit of analysis from the complete dataset to individual groups. Then, when you use the dplyr verbs on a grouped data frame they’ll be automatically applied “by group”. For example, if we applied exactly the same code to a data frame (plant_homework_clean_data) grouped by watershed, we get the average values per treatment:\n\n# Get the mean total_dry_mass_g by treatment groups\nplant_homework_clean_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(watershed) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean = mean(total_dry_mass_g))\n\nWhat happens if we try to summarise a dataset with NA’s inside?\n\n# Here is an example dataset\nNA_data &lt;- data.frame(site = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"B\"),\n                      species = c(3, 4, 6, 2, 4, NA))\n\n\n# Get the mean species by site\nNA_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(site) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean = mean(species))\n\n\n# Try this now with na.rm = TRUE\nNA_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(site) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean = mean(species, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nThat’s because aggregation functions obey the usual rule of missing values: if there’s any missing value in the input, the output will be a missing value. Fortunately, all aggregation functions have an na.rm argument which removes the missing values prior to computation. If your dataset has NAs, the na.rm = TRUE argument will be helpful.",

By comparing seedling growth in calcium-treated (W1) versus untreated (Reference) watersheds, calcium impacts on sugar maple seedling growth can be explored.\n\n\n\nSugar maple seedling laboratory photos.

    "text": "Background reading\nWeek 3 - Measurements of biodiversity\nIn this workshop, you will learn different types of ways to quantify diversity and abundance in your dataset. This section is particularly important for groups who are doing field studies, but this quantitative skill is also useful if you have a job in field ecology.\nBiodiversity can be measured using different scales and metrics, most commonly by looking at species richness (the number of different species) and species evenness (the relative proportion of individuals in each species). Other measurements include alpha, beta, and gamma diversity, which describe diversity within a single site, between sites, and across a larger region, respectively. Here, we will focus on the most common ways of quantifying diversity and abundance.\nAbundance metrics\nSpecies richness metrics\nDiversity indices\nOther types of diversity metrics such as Rényi and Tsallis diversities, taxonomic diversity and taxonomic distinctness, alpha and beta diveristy can also be done with the vegan R package.",

    "text": "Absolute abundance (\\(N_i\\)): The total number of individuals of a species recorded. A simple and intuitive calculation, but sensitive to sampling effort, i.e, cannot compare across surveys without standardisation. Only use when sampling effort is standardised (e.g., same transect length, trap nights).\nRelative abundance (\\(p_i\\)): Comparable across communities and is foundational for many diversity indices. Only use when communities have differing total abundance, or you need proportional representation, or over time.\nDensity (\\(d_i\\); individuals per area or effort): Allows spatial comparison, but requires accurate area/effort estimates. Appropriate for quadrat/plot/transect sampling.\n\n\n\nSpecies richness (\\(S\\)): The total number of unique species. A sample and intuitive calculation, but highly sensitive to sample size and rare species. Only use when comparing equally-sampled plots or as a component in more complex metrics.\nRarefied richness: Standardised species richness for a fixed number of individuals or samples. Allows fair comparison across unequal sampling effort, but assumes random sampling, i.e low resolution when sample sizes differ greatly. Only use in surveys with unequal effort.\n\n\n\nShannon diversity index (\\(H'\\)): Incorporates both species richness and evenness (the relative abundance of each species). Widely used, but difficult to interpret ecologically. Moderately sensitive to rare species, but good for comparing diversity across sites or time when both abundance and richness matter.\nSimpson’s diversity index (\\(D\\)): Emphasises the dominance of species and is less sensitive to rare species. However, underweights rare species and may mask losses in low-abundance taxa. Use in management-focused studies (dominance effects), and stable community comparisons.\n\n\n\nNew functions\nHere are some new functions from the tidyverse you will be using in this workshop.\n\npivot_longer() converts data from wide format to long format.\nstarts_with()*used inside select() to choose columns whose names begin with a specific string.\nacross()* applies a function to multiple columns in a summarise() or mutate() call. e.g. everything() = select all columns and sum = function to apply.\n.x* is a pronoun used inside anonymous functions in tidyverse pipelines—especially in across() and map(). It represents the current column being processed.\n\n’*’ See ‘Relative abundance’ section for example use.",

Before we do any analysis, we need to check the raw data for the following:\n\nCheck data structure and types: Use str() and summary() to ensure each column is the correct type (numeric, factor, character, etc.) and matches your expectations. e.g., Convert relevant character columns to factors for categorical analysis.\nInspect for missing values: Use colSums(is.na() or visual tools (e.g., naniar::gg_miss_var() or visdat_viz_dat()) to identify missing data and decide how to handle it.\nCheck for duplicates: Ensure there are no unintended duplicate rows or IDs.\nValidate categorical variables: Confirm that categories are consistent and correctly formatted (e.g., all lower case, no extra spaces).\nScan for outliers or impossible values: Look for values outside expected ranges (e.g., negative stem lengths, impossible dates).\nReview column names: Ensure column names are meaningful, have no spaces or special characters, and are consistent.\nPreview the data: Use plotting functions to visually inspect the data for obvious issues.\nCheck for extra rows or columns: Sometimes, files have summary rows, notes, or empty columns that should be removed.\n\nThese steps help ensure your data is reliable, interpretable, and suitable for statistical analysis. Importantly, it makes you a trustworthy researcher!",

Often you’ll need to create some new variables or summaries, or maybe you just want to rename the variables or reorder the observations in order to make the data a little easier to work with. In this workshop you are going to learn the five key dplyr functions (part of tidyverse) that allow you to solve the vast majority of your data manipulation challenges:\nThese can all be used in conjunction with group_by() which changes the scope of each function from operating on the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group. These six functions provide the verbs for a language of data manipulation.\nAll verbs work similarly:\nTogether these properties make it easy to chain together multiple simple steps to achieve a complex result. Let’s dive in and see how these verbs work.",

By comparing seedling growth in calcium-treated (W1) versus untreated (Reference) watersheds, calcium impacts on sugar maple seedling growth can be explored.\n\n\n\nSugar maple seedling laboratory photos.

See a more comprehensive page for more options. Here, we will create two common plots to check for outliers, and run some simple methods for detecting and removing outliers.\n\nBoxplot\nWe can use the ggplot() function from the ggplot package to create a boxplot via geom_boxplot() showing the distribution of the lead2area data.\n\n# Boxplot of leaf2area to detect potential outliers\nggplot(plant_data, aes(y = leaf2area)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\nWarning: Removed 117 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram\nAnother way we can visualise outliers is with histograms via geom_histogram() or density plots via geom_density()\n\n# Boxplot of height to detect potential outliers\nggplot(plant_data, aes(x = leaf2area)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

You can either manually remove the outlier on Excel, or with the following code below.\nOption: Remove outliers using the interquartile range (IQR) rule.\n\n# View potential outliers using IQR rule\nQ1 &lt;- quantile(plant_data$leaf2area, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)\nQ3 &lt;- quantile(plant_data$leaf2area, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)\nIQR &lt;- Q3 - Q1\n\n# Filter rows with height outside 1.5 * IQR range\noutliers &lt;- filter(plant, height &lt; (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR) | height &gt; (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))\noutliers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDon’t just blindly remove outliers!\n\n\nMake sure the numbers are biologically realistic based on intuition and comparing with the literature.

Sometimes, transformation is required for certain data to meet the assumptions of certain statistical methods and improve the interpretability and performance of models. Many statistical techniques—like linear regression, ANOVA, and t-tests—assume that the data is normally distributed, has constant variance, and is linearly related (from your MAS183 - Statistical Data Analysis and MAS224 - Biostatistical Methods units). If the data is skewed, has outliers, or shows non-constant variance (heteroscedasticity), these assumptions are violated, which can lead to biased estimates, incorrect conclusions, or poor model fit.\nBy applying transformations such as logarithmic, square root, or Box-Cox, we can:\n\nReduce skewness and make the distribution more symmetrical.\nStabilise variance across levels of an independent variable.\nImprove linearity between variables.\nMinimise the influence of outliers.\n\nLet’s check the distribution of leaf2area after removing that one outlier.\n\n # remove values above 100\nplant_data_clean &lt;- plant_data %&gt;%\n  filter(leaf2area &lt; 100)\n\nggplot(plant_data_clean, aes(x = leaf2area)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

    "text": "2.1 Check for outliers\nOutliers aren’t inherently “bad,” but they can cause problems depending on the context and goals of your analysis. They can:\n\nSkew statistical results: A single extreme value can pull the mean far from the center, increase variability making data seem more spread than it really us, and can distrort the slope and intercept of linear models, leading to misleading predictions.\nCreate obscure patterns: Hide clusters or trends that would otherwise be visible.\nIndicate user error: Data entry mistakes (e.g., typing 1000 instead of 100), measurement errors (e.g., faulty sensors), incorrect data merging (e.g., mixing units like metres and feet).\n\nThere are different ways we can check for outliers. See a more comprehensive page for more options. Here, we will create two common plots to check for outliers, and run some simple methods for detecting and removing outliers.\n\nBoxplot\nWe can use the ggplot() function from the ggplot package to create a boxplot via geom_boxplot() showing the distribution of the lead2area data.\n\n# Boxplot of leaf2area to detect potential outliers\nggplot(plant_data, aes(y = leaf2area)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\nWarning: Removed 117 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram\nAnother way we can visualise outliers is with histograms via geom_histogram() or density plots via geom_density()\n\n# Boxplot of height to detect potential outliers\nggplot(plant_data, aes(x = leaf2area)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value `binwidth`.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 117 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere you can see one clear outlier with a value above 100. All other values are below 25. You can either manually remove the outlier on Excel, or with the following code below.\nOption: Remove outliers using the interquartile range (IQR) rule.\n\n# View potential outliers using IQR rule\nQ1 &lt;- quantile(plant_data$leaf2area, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)\nQ3 &lt;- quantile(plant_data$leaf2area, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)\nIQR &lt;- Q3 - Q1\n\n# Filter rows with height outside 1.5 * IQR range\noutliers &lt;- filter(plant, height &lt; (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR) | height &gt; (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))\noutliers\n\nMake sure the numbers are biologically realistic based on intuition and comparing with the literature. If the values are unrealistic, it is a safe assumption to remove them.",

    "text": "2.2 Is the data normally distributed\nThis step is required to check if the data is suitable for certain types of analysis. Sometimes, transformation is required for certain data to meet the assumptions of certain statistical methods and improve the interpretability and performance of models. Many statistical techniques—like linear regression, ANOVA, and t-tests—assume that the data is normally distributed, has constant variance, and is linearly related (from your MAS183 - Statistical Data Analysis and MAS224 - Biostatistical Methods units). If the data is skewed, has outliers, or shows non-constant variance (heteroscedasticity), these assumptions are violated, which can lead to biased estimates, incorrect conclusions, or poor model fit.\nBy applying transformations such as logarithmic, square root, or Box-Cox, we can:\n\nReduce skewness and make the distribution more symmetrical.\nStabilise variance across levels of an independent variable.\nImprove linearity between variables.\nMinimise the influence of outliers.\n\nLet’s check the distribution of leaf2area after removing that one outlier.\n\n# remove values above 100\nplant_data_clean &lt;- plant_data %&gt;%\n  filter(leaf2area &lt; 100)\n\nggplot(plant_data_clean, aes(x = leaf2area)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

From here, we will focus on mean and median, which can be calculated using the mean() and median() function, respectively.\n\n#install.packages(\"cowplot\")\n\n# Load library\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\n# Create fake data distribution\nset.seed(1)\ndist_data &lt;- data.frame(normal = rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 2),\n                        skewed = rexp(100, rate = 0.2))\n\ndist_data %&gt;%\n  dplyr::summarise(normal_mean = mean(normal),\n                   normal_median = median(normal),\n                   skewed_mean = mean(skewed),\n                   skewed_median = median(skewed))\n\n  normal_mean normal_median skewed_mean skewed_median\n1    10.21777      10.22782    4.656321      3.781882\n\n\nIf the data is normally distributed, the mean and median will be similar (e.g. normal = 10), but if the data is skewed, the mean and median will show different central tenancies (e.g. mean = 4.7, median = 3).",

For example, if the median is 10, this indicates that half of the data points lie below 10 and half above.\nQuartiles: The ends of the box indicate the upper (Q3) and lower (Q1) quartiles. If Q3 is 15, this means that 75% of the observations fall below this value.\nInterquartile Range (IQR): The difference between Quartiles 1 and 3 is known as the interquartile range (IQR), which measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data.\nWhiskers: The lines extending from the box show the range of values within Q3 + 1.5 × IQR to Q1 - 1.5 × IQR, representing the highest and lowest values, excluding outliers.\nOutliers: Dots (or other markers) beyond the whiskers indicate potential outliers in the dataset.\n\n\nTo create a boxplot by group, use the geom_boxplot() function within ggplot.\n\nplant_task_clean_data %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = watershed, y = stem_length)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo plot the mean and standard deviation as a bar plot, use the geom_bar() function with geom_errorbar().\n\nplant_sum &lt;- plant_task_clean_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(watershed) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean = mean(stem_length),\n            sd = sd(stem_length))\n\n\nplant_sum %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = watershed)) +\n  geom_bar(aes(y = mean), stat = \"identity\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean-sd, ymax = mean+sd), width = .02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo plot the mean and standard deviation as a dot plot, use the geom_pointrange().
